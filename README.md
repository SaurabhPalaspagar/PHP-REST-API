# PHP-REST-API

This is a tutorial to cerate a REST API using PHP within a few minutes and understand the basics of API rest endpoints.
Its simple to build and easy to access on localhost.

# Config.php

This is where you should add all the details related to the database

# Update.php

This is the REST API POST request made to the database. It is simply a POST method with a insert query.
You can add more methods like GET, PUT etc. Place this in the configured local host or the web hosting provider
you are using for the project.
This service will then be avaialble at https://localhost//update.php?firstName=xyz or https://example.com//update.php?firstName=xyz

**The best way to test the endpoints is using the  [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/) which is a GUI for testing API's**

# SQL FILE user.sql

This is the SQL table stored in the database. Modify it according to your requirements.
